## Overview


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- Vehicle length and ground clearance provided variance to the mpg vales in the dataset.
- The slope of the linear is not zero because the p-value is less than 0.05. Therefore, the null hypothesis is be rejected. 
- This linear model does effectively predict mpg of MechaCar effectively. The r-square-value is 0.71, meaning that the linear regression model will correctly predict 71% times.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

### Lot Summary

- According to design specifications, the coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Therefore, the total lot summary does meet specifications. When looking at the lot summary only lots 1 and 2 meets specifications. Lot 3 does not meet the specifiations.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
### T-test for All Lots

- The p-value is greater than 0.05. Therfore, we can consider the null hypothesis to be true. The total lots are not statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

### T-tests for Each Lot

- The p-values for lots for 1 and 2 are greater than 0.05. Therefore, these lots are not statistically different from the population mean. However, the p-value for lot 3 is less than 0.05. Lot three is significantly different from the population mean.
