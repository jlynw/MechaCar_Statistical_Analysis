- Vehicle length and ground clearance provided variance to the mpg vales in the dataset.
- The slope of the linear is not zero because the p-value is less than 0.05. Therefore, the null hypothesis is be rejected. 
- This linear model does effectively predict mpg of MechaCar effectively. The r-square-value is 0.71, meaning that the linear regression model will correctly predict 71% times.
